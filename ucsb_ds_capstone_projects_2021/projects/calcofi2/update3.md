# Update 3

## Overview

After update 1 and 2, we have been working on connecting the more independent explorations and progress we have made to get closer to our main goal of correlating pH with larval fish abundance. We have stepped beyond the inital exploratory aspects of the project and have completed data processing, began exploring species correlations, and looked further into kriging for data interpolation. With our calculations of pH, we are beginning to explore its relationship to the species and other factors in our datasets. 

## Reiterating Our Project and Goal

In our project, we aim to correlate water data containing many water characteristics at a given location and time, to our fish data, in order to draw better understand relationships between how water characteristics affect the makeup of specific species in California's oceans. We are especially interested in seeing how water pH affects the makeup of these fish species. We hope that our conclusions can be used to for one, be able to accurately infer what the makeup of fish looks like at a given time where we know the water makeup, and two also be able to predict what the makeup of fish should look like in the future. We hope that this will help reduce the effort needed to be able to get a portrayal of the makeup of fish, since currently usually sampling the fish by a boat all along California's oceans is the effort that is needed.

We are have a water time series dataset, what gives information about many water characteristics over many different locations, from 2008-2015, and we also have a fish time series dataset that tells us the abundance of each fish species at a given location and time, from the 1960's until present.
